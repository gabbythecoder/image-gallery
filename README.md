# Accessible Image Gallery 

Week 2 assignment - Build an Accessible Image Gallery

Created a fictional webpage with an accessible image gallery as part of the Tech Educators course.

This is built on VSCode using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Requirements
* 🎯 Implement responsive design methods to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens (e.g., above 800px). ✅
* 🎯 Implement at least one meaningful media query so that there is a noticeable change between mobile and desktop view (an example is to change where the ‘thumbnail bar’ is positioned). ✅
* 🎯 Ensure all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility. ✅
* 🎯 Correctly use event handlers to switch images based on user interactions. ✅

## Stretch Requirements
* 🏹 Use ‘srcset’ to specify which image will be used based on the size of the screen for optimal viewing experience.
* 🏹 Add ARIA elements to improve accessibility, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes.
* 🏹 Implement key bindings for buttons to enhance navigation, such as using arrow keys to switch between images. ✅

## Reflection 

Required
* 🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
* 🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
* 🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

Optional (basically required)
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

* Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
* What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
* What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
* What went really well and what could have gone better?

I have successfully completed the requirements for this project. I have to admit, this assignment really tested my coding abilities, particularly the JavaScript side of it. 

I initially struggled with the createLargeImageHandler function. For some reason, I was not able to link my images array to the function, and the console kept coming up with errors. I added an event parameter in the function, and now everytime I click on a thumbnail, the large image showed up. I continuously console.log() throughout my JavaScript to debug my code, to ensure there was no error popping up. 

I added a media query for my thumbnail container. When the device size shrinks, it moves to the bottom of the page instead for better accessibility, especially for mobile devices. I particularly focused this assignment for mobile devices, but it is responsive and works for larger desktop screens. All my images have appropriate alt text attributes. I also used a colour contrast checker to make sure the colours I used, especially in my header and footer have good contrast ratio. 



After numerous trial and errors, this assignment is completed.
