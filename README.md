# Accessible Image Gallery 

Week 2 assignment - Build an Accessible Image Gallery

Created a fictional webpage with an accessible image gallery as part of the Tech Educators course.

This is built on VSCode using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Requirements
* 🎯 Implement responsive design methods to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens (e.g., above 800px). ✅
* 🎯 Implement at least one meaningful media query so that there is a noticeable change between mobile and desktop view (an example is to change where the ‘thumbnail bar’ is positioned). ✅
* 🎯 Ensure all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility. ✅
* 🎯 Correctly use event handlers to switch images based on user interactions. ✅

## Stretch Requirements
* 🏹 Use ‘srcset’ to specify which image will be used based on the size of the screen for optimal viewing experience.
* 🏹 Add ARIA elements to improve accessibility, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes.
* 🏹 Implement key bindings for buttons to enhance navigation, such as using arrow keys to switch between images.

## Reflection
