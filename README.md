# Accessible Image Gallery 

Week 2 assignment - Build an Accessible Image Gallery

Created a fictional webpage with an accessible image gallery as part of the Tech Educators course.

This is built on VSCode using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Requirements
* üéØ Implement responsive design methods to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens (e.g., above 800px). ‚úÖ
* üéØ Implement at least one meaningful media query so that there is a noticeable change between mobile and desktop view (an example is to change where the ‚Äòthumbnail bar‚Äô is positioned). ‚úÖ
* üéØ Ensure all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility. ‚úÖ
* üéØ Correctly use event handlers to switch images based on user interactions. ‚úÖ

## Stretch Requirements
* üèπ Use ‚Äòsrcset‚Äô to specify which image will be used based on the size of the screen for optimal viewing experience. ‚úÖ
* üèπ Add ARIA elements to improve accessibility, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes. ‚ùì
* üèπ Implement key bindings for buttons to enhance navigation, such as using arrow keys to switch between images. ‚úÖ

### Links I found useful 
I have done a lot of research during this assignment and I have linked the websites and YouTube tutorial that I found very helpful. I also used the resources that was provided to us during class and on Moodle.

## Reflection 

I have successfully completed the requirements for this project. I have to admit, this assignment really tested my coding abilities, particularly the JavaScript side of it. 

I initially struggled with the createLargeImageHandler function. For some reason, I was not able to link my images array to the function, and the console kept coming up with errors. I added an event parameter in the function, and now everytime I click on a thumbnail, the large image showed up. I continuously console.log() throughout my JavaScript to debug my code, to ensure there was no new error popping up. 

I added a media query for my thumbnail container. When the device size shrinks, it moves to the bottom of the page instead for better accessibility, especially for mobile devices. I particularly focused this assignment for mobile devices, but it is responsive and works for larger desktop screens. I know there are a lot of whitespace when viewing my webpage in desktop, but I didn't want to waste too much time trying to fill it up as I primarily wanted to focus on the JavaScript and making sure the website is responsive for other devices. 

All my images have appropriate alt text attributes. I also used a colour contrast checker to make sure the colours I used, especially in my header and footer have good contrast ratio for better accessibility. I have added srcset and when copying the image address, I know it works, however, I am not sure how to check it in the website. When I shrink and expand the website, the images looks the same to me. 

I have added buttons for navigation when the large image pops up after clicking on the thumbnail. The code I have written for each prevButton and nextButton event listener is very repetitive but I am not so sure how to simplify it. If I could get your feedback on this, that would be great as I do want to try to incorporate the DRY method as much as possible to keep my codes clear and concise. 

I added keyboard navigation for when my large image pops up using the arrowkey left and right to navigate between the pictures in the pop up. I also added escape to toggle out of the pop-up rather than clicking the 'x' in the top right corner. Both works to exit out of the pop-up. This was the most difficult part I found when doing the assignment. 

With the aria-labels, I have added them on the close pop-up button for the large image, the previous button and the next button. I'm not sure if I have added this correctly but I at least wanted to attempt it which is why I left a question mark in the stretch requirement for this particularly task.

Overall, I found this assignment to be very tricky. I felt very overwhelmed when the assignment was first introduced and to be honest, I didn't think I was able to complete it. This was the most difficult coding experience so far but I do love a good challenge. Numerous tutorials and research have gone into this assignment and I have now managed to create an accessible image gallery. I do feel very proud of myself with how much I have achieved already, given it is only the second week of the course.

Any feedback will be appreciated as I am always looking for ways to continuously improve.
